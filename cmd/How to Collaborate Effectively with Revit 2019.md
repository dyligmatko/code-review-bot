# How to Collaborate Effectively with Revit 2019
 
Revit 2019 is a powerful software for building information modeling (BIM) that enables architects, engineers, and contractors to design, construct, and manage buildings and infrastructure projects. One of the key features of Revit 2019 is the ability to collaborate with other project stakeholders using cloud-based services such as BIM 360 Design.

BIM 360 Design is a cloud-based solution that allows multidisciplinary teams to work together simultaneously on the same Revit model, regardless of their location or time zone. BIM 360 Design also provides data management and collaboration tools such as 2D and 3D viewer, markup tool, access controls, change analytics, project activity tracking, connected issues, and automated clash detection.
 
In this article, we will show you how to set up and use BIM 360 Design with Revit 2019 to collaborate effectively with your project team.
  
## Setting up BIM 360 Design with Revit 2019
 
To use BIM 360 Design with Revit 2019, you need to have a subscription to BIM 360 Design and an Autodesk account. You also need to install the latest updates for Revit 2019 and BIM 360 add-ins for Revit.
 
Once you have these prerequisites, you can follow these steps to set up BIM 360 Design with Revit 2019:
 
1. Log in to your Autodesk account and go to [BIM 360 Admin](https://admin.b360.autodesk.com/).
2. Create a new project or open an existing one.
3. Invite your project team members and assign them roles and permissions.
4. Activate the Document Management and Design Collaboration services for your project.
5. Create folders and subfolders for your project files and set access permissions for them.
6. Open Revit 2019 and click on Collaborate tab.
7. Select Collaborate using BIM 360 Document Management.
8. Select your project and folder from the list.
9. Save your model as a cloud workshared model in BIM 360.

## Using BIM 360 Design with Revit 2019
 
Once you have saved your model as a cloud workshared model in BIM 360, you can start collaborating with your project team using BIM 360 Design. Here are some of the main features and workflows that you can use:
  
### Co-authoring
 
Co-authoring allows you to work on the same model with other team members at the same time. You can use the Worksets panel in Revit to create and manage worksets, which are subsets of elements that can be owned by different users. You can also use the Synchronize with Central command to save your changes to the cloud and get the latest changes from other users. You can also use the Reload Latest command to get the latest changes without saving your own changes.
  
### Packaging and sharing
 
Packaging and sharing allows you to exchange models with other disciplines or teams using design packages. You can use the Design Collaboration module in BIM 360 to create, consume, and track design packages. A design package is a snapshot of a model that can be shared with other teams for review or coordination. You can also use the Compare tool to compare different versions of design packages and see what has changed.
  
### Reviewing and commenting
 
Reviewing and commenting allows you to communicate with other team members about the design using issues. You can use the Issues module in BIM 360 to create, assign, resolve, and track issues on a model. You can also use the Issues add-in for Revit to view and resolve issues directly in Revit. You can also use the Viewer module in BIM 360 to view and markup models in 2D or 3D using a web browser or a mobile device.
  
### Clash detection
 
Clash detection allows you to identify and resolve conflicts between different models or disciplines using clash tests. You can use the Clash module in BIM
